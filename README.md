# Infinite-Moonshine
is an automated device for ethanol rectification. It is controlled by the single-board computer with an arduino mega connected via asynchronous port. Aruino is connected to the sensors and the step engines, while computer runs rectification algorithm.


Arduino firmware **requires** following libraries: [BMP180](https://github.com/sparkfun/BMP180_Breakout), [DS18B20](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library.git), [OneWire](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire)
